The plane defined by (x-a)*n =0 is:
  a = (700.5, 200.1, 100.12)
  n = (1, 2, 3.12)
The eye e is: 
  e = (1000, 900.23, 100.116)
Vertices I used to create he 2d coordinate system and their projections are: 
v1 = (150, -150, -150)
v2 = (-150, -150, -150)
v3 = (150, -150, 150)

pv1 = (612.744, 421.75, -13.836)
pv2 = (515.059, 457.361, -5.355)
pv3 = (483.049, 261.504, 130.454)

The 2 vectors a and b that are in plane are:
a = pv1-pv2 = (97.6841, -35.6116, -8.48102)
b = pv3-pv1 = (-129.694, -160.246, 144.29)

The w1 and w2 obtained from a and b (these now are perpendicular and of magnitude 1) are:
w1 = (0.816384, -0.568315, 0.102643)
w2 = (-0.515411, -0.636824, 0.573416)

The center of the cube in first frame and its projection are:
center  = (1100.5,500.1,200.1)
p0 = (360,469)

I Finished 8.3!
This Log File is wayyy to overcomplicated for me to continue implementing it. Srry :(
